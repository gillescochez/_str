Mostly created for fun _str is a little strings manipulation library which aims to simplify heavy strings manipulation. 

Usage: var str = _str(' place some string here ').trim().upFirst().append('.').prepend('Example:').end();

It's structured is inspired by jQuery (http://jquery.com) and strings manipulation methods are inspired or partially taken from phpjs (http://phpjs.org).

Thanks to both projects for their amazing work.
